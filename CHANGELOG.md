# Changelog

All notable changes to Warden are documented in this file.

## [v0.2.0] — 2026-03-04

### New Features

- **High Availability with Standby Nodes** — Active/standby HA using PostgreSQL advisory locks for leader election. Standby nodes forward requests to the leader via mTLS reverse proxy. Automatic failover when the leader becomes unavailable, with sealed-node protection to prevent forwarding to unhealthy nodes. Health and status endpoints (`sys/health`, `sys/leader`, `sys/seal-status`, `sys/init`, `sys/ready`) are served locally by standby nodes without forwarding. (#54)
- **OpenAI AI Provider** — Native OpenAI provider with transparent gateway mode. (#52)
- **Mistral AI Provider** — Native Mistral AI provider with transparent gateway mode. (#50)
- **Opt-in Request Body Parsing for Streaming Requests** — Streaming requests can now opt in to request body parsing for policy evaluation while preserving the original stream. (#49)
- **E2E Test Suite** — Comprehensive end-to-end tests running against a 3-node HA cluster covering cluster health, HA failover, request forwarding, provider integration, credential management, rotation, namespaces, seal/unseal, authentication, audit logging, and concurrency.

### Bug Fixes

- **SigV4 Host Header Preservation** — Fixed AWS SigV4 signature verification failure when requests are forwarded through standby nodes. The reverse proxy no longer rewrites the `Host` header, preserving the original value needed for signature verification. (#54)
- **Dependabot Unblocked** — Fixed broken OpenBao sub-module references that prevented Dependabot from running. (#35)

### Infrastructure

- **Go 1.26.0** — Upgraded from Go 1.25.1. (#48)
- **CI Updates** — Bumped `actions/checkout` to v6, `actions/setup-go` to v6, `goreleaser/goreleaser-action` to v7. (#36, #37, #38)
- **Dependency Updates** — Updated `github.com/cloudflare/circl`, `github.com/go-chi/chi`, and various Go module dependencies. (#41, #42, #44, #47)

## [v0.1.1] — 2025-12-22

### Bug Fix

- **fix: handle custom dev root tokens in LookupToken** — `LookupToken` failed with `"failed to detect token type"` when using `--dev-root-token` with a custom value that lacks a standard prefix. Added the same dev-mode fallback that `ResolveToken` already had. (#33)
